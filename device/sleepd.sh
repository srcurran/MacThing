# Car Thing sleep watchdog — runs on the device itself, under supervisord.
#
# While the bridge is connected it owns the backlight: it writes the heartbeat file every few
# seconds with the state it wants the screen in. When the Mac goes away — shut down, asleep with
# the port still powered, cable pulled, bridge stopped — that heartbeat stops, and nothing else
# on the device would ever turn the backlight off: the "Waiting for your Mac" screen would stay
# lit for as long as the Car Thing has power. This notices, and puts the panel to sleep until
# someone presses a button or turns the knob.
#
# Installed at /var/lib/carthing/sleepd.sh by scripts/setup-device.sh; the bridge pushes updates
# to it, and to /var/lib/carthing/sleep.conf, whenever it connects.

# When the Mac suspends it stops driving the port, and this firmware's gadget doesn't always come

# keeps power from a hub. Rebinding the UDC is that cure, without the unplugging.

# The gate is what keeps this safe: it only ever runs when the heartbeat has been quiet for HEAL
# seconds AND no host has the gadget configured. A working link — even an idle one with the bridge
# stopped — reads "configured", so a rebind can never interrupt something that was working.
