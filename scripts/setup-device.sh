# One-time device setup (safe to re-run). Needs the Car Thing connected with adb access.
#
#  1. Points the boot web app (/usr/share/qt-superbird-app/webapp) at /var/lib/carthing/ui,
#     keeping Spotify's original as webapp.spotify. Future UI updates then never touch the
#     read-only rootfs — the bridge just syncs /var/lib/carthing/ui.
#  2. Stops Spotify's background app (qt-superbird-app) from autostarting: with no Spotify
#     service it only burns ~15% CPU on "Hey Spotify" wake-word listening and BT pairing.
#     The original supervisord.conf is kept as supervisord.conf.spotify.
#  3. Installs device/sleepd.sh as a supervisord program, so the Car Thing turns its own
#     backlight off when the Mac stops talking to it — shut down, asleep, or unplugged from
#     everything but power. Any button or the knob wakes it.
#
# Undo everything with scripts/restore-device.sh.
